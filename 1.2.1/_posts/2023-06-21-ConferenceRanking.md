附件是计算机领域的学术会议等级排名情况，分为A+
, A, B, C, L 共5个档次。其中A+
属于顶级会议，基本是这个领域全世界大牛们参与和关注最多的会议。国内的研究者能在其中发表论文的话，是很值得骄傲的成就。

A类也是非常好的会议了，尤其是一些热门的研究方向，A类的会议投稿多录用率低，部分A类会议影响力逐步逼近A+
类会议。

B类的会议分两种，一种称为盛会级，参与的人多，发表的论文也多，论文录用难度比上两个级别要低很多，通常是行业内的学者们年度交流的好时机。一种是专业级的小会，圈子往往比较小，但是也有一些相对质量不错的成果发表。另外B类也是一个分水岭，是区分NB成果和普通成果的分界线。

C类会议知名度就低很多了，而L级的会议更多。如果不是为了注水，而是追求论文的质量多过数量的话，不建议在L级会议上发表论文。除此以外计算机还有更多的会议不在列表内，这些属于更不入流的会议了
